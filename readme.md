Took down live site, however, you can watch screencast below for demo. This was a project for Dynamic Web Apps class. Also see p1, p2, and p3. 

## Description
A web application that enables users to login and store climbs that they have completed. They can also browse climbs
that other users have added and add climbs to their own climbs' list. Administrators of climbs are users that have
added the climb or have been given administrator priviliges for a specific climb. Only administrators can edit or
delete a climb. A user can upload a profile photo, reset their password, create new climbs, edit their profile, add
and remove climbs from their list, browse all climbs, edit and delete climbs that they are the administrator, and pass
administrator privileges to other users if they are the administrator of a climb.
