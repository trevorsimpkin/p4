## Description
A web application that enables users to login and store climbs that they have completed. They can also browse climbs
that other users have added and add climbs to their own climbs' list. Administrators of climbs are users that have
added the climb or have been given administrator priviliges for a specific climb. Only administrators can edit or
delete a climb. A user can upload a profile photo, reset their password, create new climbs, edit their profile, add
and remove climbs from their list, browse all climbs, edit and delete climbs that they are the administrator, and pass
administrator privileges to other users if they are the administrator of a climb.

## Details for teaching team
I've noticed that if a larger image is uploaded then Laravel rotates it during the upload. I could not find an easy way
to fix this problem.
